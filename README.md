# Calculator-Project-for-Micro-IT
The Calculator project is a basic desktop application built using Java Swing that performs fundamental arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It features a clean and user-friendly graphical interface, allowing users to input numbers and instantly compute results by clicking operation buttons.

This project demonstrates the use of Java GUI components such as JFrame, JTextField, JButton, and JLabel, along with event handling using ActionListener. The interface also includes input validation and a reset/clear option for user convenience.
